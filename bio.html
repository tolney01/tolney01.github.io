	<h1> My name is Tyler Olney </h1>
	<p> I am a senior at Tufts University majoring in mechanical engineering and pursuing minors in computer science and entrepreneurial leadership studies. I have excelled in a rigorous course schedule focused both on designing cutting edge products and the markets that govern their adoption. As part of my coursework I have completed numerous relevant projects, such as designing and prototyping numerous devices, writing complex programs in multiple coding languages, and submitting two separate in-depth business plans for potential start-ups. Outside of class, my research at the CNSE lead to an exhaustive report on photovoltaic testing standards, which was subsequently dispersed directly to companies via the Photovoltaic Manufacturerâ€™s Consortium. This depth of engineering and business expertise is augmented by my strong experience helping companies contextualize their product within their market. I consulted with SPOT Parking to develop a marketing plan to help them increase transactions, and as an intern for MTPV Power Corporation I completed thorough market requirement analysis featuring a comprehensive, bottom-up market model including details on nearly 20,000 industrial clients around the world. Beyond this, I am also a captain of the Tufts Men's Lacrosse team and the chair of the Career Development Committee for Tau Beta Pi, the Engineering Honor Society. I believe that my acquired skills in engineering and customer-focused design, strong work ethic and leadership, and my desire to learn more would provide a great asset. </p>
